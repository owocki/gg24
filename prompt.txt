important:
- clean up after yourself, do not alter any files besides data/data.csv and data/data.md
- use the data in /posts
- use the scripts in scripts/ if needed. 
- when filling out the information, use the most concise representation of the tldr as possible. unless explicitly asked to be verbose, put less than 1 sentence in each row, keep it very concise. 
- fill out the scorecard for each proposal using kevin owockis vision and voice.
- do 3 posts as a test first, then let me check the output. then well do the remainder.
- after you are done evaluating each proposal put the following content at the top of the markdown file

```
