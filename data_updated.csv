Ethereum has invested deeply in collective infrastructure — but often overlooks the inner architecture of collaboration. Gitcoin grants fund public goods teams doing vital work. But after the grant hits a multisig, how the funds are shared within those teams often lacks structure, visibility, or intentionality. While Gitcoin tracks project-level transparency through tools like karma.gap or Dune dashboards, the human layer — the dynamics of peer","funding, aiming to evolve beyond one-size-fits-all grants. But while distribution mechanisms multiply, the “last mile” of internal allocation is still under-addressed. DAOs, mutual aid groups, and open-source projects often operate with blurred roles and shifting commitments. But when funding arrives, they fall back on informal or founder-led decisions about “who gets what.” It’s not ill intent — it’s a lack of structure. And it leaves contributors feeling uncertain, undervalued, or disconnected","@migrenaa, What specific, Ethereum problem, are you, Ethereum has",https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg24-sensemaking-report-at-pre-post-grant-coordination-from-allocation-to-alignment-accountability/21711,"& Reflection What specific outcomes will show success within 6 months?
