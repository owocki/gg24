# Outcome Based Funding for Web3 Popups
## by thedevanshmehta

## TLDR

Build transparent impact-driven funding for Web3 popups with documented evaluation

## Problem

Web3 popup residencies like Zuzalu lack transparent budgeting and impact measurement

## Solution

Require Hypercerts with costs/outputs, calculate impact scores for proportional funding

## Domain Experts

@nidiyia, @JamesFarrell

## Target Projects

Web3 popup cities, residencies, IRL gatherings

## Risks

Financial opacity, informal impact stories, misallocated capital

## Outside Funding

Must have <30% from GG24, need co-funding from other sources
