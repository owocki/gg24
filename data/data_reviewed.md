<span style="color:red">**Review comment: Major issues identified across the evaluation:**
1. **Generic feedback copying**: Many proposals have identical "bud" feedback about "Potential to lead Ethereum's AI integration" when most have nothing to do with AI
2. **Template-driven evaluation**: The feedback appears to use templates rather than specific analysis of each proposal
3. **Inconsistent scoring**: Some well-developed proposals with detailed plans and experienced teams (like Privacy-Preserving KYC by a former Gitcoin operator) receive low scores
4. **Duplicate entries**: At least 2 duplicate proposals in the list
5. **Rose/Thorn repetition**: Almost all proposals have identical "Clear vision and communication" as the rose, suggesting lack of individual assessment</span>

<span style="color:red">Review comment: The scoring seems reasonable for this proposal. However, after reading the full HTML content, this proposal is actually quite detailed with specific implementation plans, timeline, and partnerships mentioned. The author has direct experience with multiple popup events and provides concrete metrics. The score of 4/14 may be too low given the thoroughness and author expertise.</span>

### Score

Confidence : 90%
Total Score: 4 / 14

### Feedback:

- Clarify the specific problem and why it's urgent for Ethereum's success
- Strengthen the evidence base - show prior success or research backing
- Build out team with more domain experts and proven executors
- Develop co-funding strategy to show broader support
- Accelerate development to meet October delivery timeline
- Needs significant strengthening before funding consideration
- Consider partnering with established projects
- Identify specific projects or partners for implementation

### Rose, bud, and thorn:

**Rose (strength):** Clear vision and communication
**Thorn (weakness):** Execution timeline unrealistic - needs acceleration
**Bud (potential):** Innovative funding model could set new standards

### Steel man case for/against:

#### For

Team has relevant experience to execute. Clear value proposition in Community

#### Against

Execution timeline suggests project may not deliver by October. Lack of co-funding suggests limited external validation. Multiple fundamental weaknesses reduce success probability

# (4) [DeFi Transparency and Decentralization Assessment](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg24-sensemaking-report-defi-transparency-and-decentralization-assessment/22966)

by marcvlad

## Proposal

### TLDR

This sensemaking report proposes a Gitcoin GG24 domain, "DeFi Transparency & Decentralization Assessment" (or "DeFi Curation"), to fund open-source tools, standards, and education for evaluating DeFi 

### Problem

Problem statement not clearly articulated - needs definition of specific challenge being addressed

<span style="color:red">Review comment: This is incorrect - the proposal clearly articulates the "decentralization illusion" problem in DeFi where protocols claim decentralization but have hidden centralized risks. The problem statement is well-defined.</span>

### Solution

Solution approach not clearly defined - needs specific methodology and implementation details

<span style="color:red">Review comment: The proposal actually outlines specific solutions including DeFiScan methodology, bounty systems, and frameworks inspired by L2Beat. The evaluation appears to have missed this content.</span>

### Domain Experts

No domain experts identified - team composition unclear
Credentials and experience not specified

<span style="color:red">Review comment: The proposal mentions DeFiScan team, L2Beat contributors, and security/decentralization researchers. Domain experts are identified.</span>

### Target Projects (Examples)

<span style="color:red">Review comment: The scoring here seems inconsistent with the actual proposal content. The proposal clearly articulates the decentralization illusion problem, has specific solutions, mentions existing track record ($100K+ raised), and identifies domain experts. The score appears to be based on a surface reading rather than thorough analysis.</span>

### Score

Confidence : 75%
Total Score: 4 / 14

### Feedback:

- Clarify the specific problem and why it's urgent for Ethereum's success
- Strengthen the evidence base - show prior success or research backing
- Build out team with more domain experts and proven executors
- Develop co-funding strategy to show broader support
- Great execution readiness - ready to ship

- Consider partnering with established projects
- Identify specific projects or partners for implementation

### Rose, bud, and thorn:

**Rose (strength):** Clear vision and communication

Clear value proposition in AI/ML

<span style="color:red">Review comment: This proposal is about DeFi transparency, not AI/ML. This appears to be copied from another evaluation.</span>

#### Against

Lack of co-funding suggests limited external validation. Team lacks proven track record in this domain. Multiple fundamental weaknesses reduce success probability

### Steel man case for/against:

#### For

Addresses a genuine ecosystem need that impacts many projects. Approach has theoretical or empirical backing. Community-driven approach ensures grassroots adoption

#### Against

Execution timeline suggests project may not deliver by October. Lack of co-funding suggests limited external validation. Team lacks proven track record in this domain

Fragmented Fundraising & Support Gaps for Early-Stage Web3 Startups 1

### Problem

& Impact The Problem:  Ethereum's early-stage startups face fragmented fundraising mechanisms, inadequate mentorship access, and high failure rates due to operational friction. Projects struggle to secure fair capital, navigate compliance, and access real-time liquidity during critical growth phases

by M0nkeyFl0wer

## Proposal

### TLDR

Big props to @owocki and @MathildaDV for pushing this sensemaking approach forward

### Problem

s I ran into while running Gitcoin Grants was KYC. It is a legal requirement, but it is also an Achilles heel for much of the Web3 space, creating massive honeypots of personal data that are magnets for trouble. I am putting this report forward to explore how Gitcoin could lead the charge in buildin

<span style="color:red">Review comment: The problem is very well articulated with specific examples of KYC breaches and concrete impact analysis. This appears to be understated in the summary.</span>

### Solution

forward. One of the biggest pain points I ran into while running Gitcoin Grants was KYC. It is a legal requirement, but it is also an Achilles heel for much of the Web3 space, creating massive honeypots of personal data that are magnets for trouble.
