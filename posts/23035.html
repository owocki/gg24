              <h1><a name="tldr-1" class="anchor" href="#tldr-1"></a>TL;DR</h1>
<p>This proposal outlines the critical need for ‚ÄúOpen Civic Innovation‚Äù as a dedicated domain allocator within Gitcoin Grants 3.0 (GG24), focused on directing public goods funding towards participatory governance, civic technology, and democratic innovation. This initiative positions Ethereum as the foundational infrastructure for the emerging ‚Äúcivic renaissance,‚Äù where decentralized coordination mechanisms enable communities to co-design vital, resilient, and participatory civic systems.</p>
<p>The proposal leverages OpenCivics‚Äô proven track record of distributing over $122,000 through quadratic funding on Gitcoin Grants, early funding that helped to establish a solidarity network of over 100 Consortium members that is currently primed to develop replicable templates and knowledge capital for multi-mechanism community grants programs. OpenCivics provides an emerging DAO and network community as a scalable model for domain-specific capital allocation in which experimental, network-based capital allocation mechanisms can be explored and supported by a comprehensive framework for civic innovation.</p>
<p>The rationale is built upon three foundational arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Why Now?</strong> The global civic sphere is facing a democratic deficit marked by declining trust and institutional failure, while the Ethereum ecosystem is simultaneously grappling with its own internal challenges related to governance centralization, user experience fragmentation, and the need for a purpose-driven narrative beyond speculative finance. This unique convergence creates a timely opportunity for Ethereum to establish itself as the global, credibly neutral infrastructure for the entire next generation civilizational stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why This?</strong> The domain of Open Civic Innovation offers a theoretically-grounded framework for addressing these dual deficits. By focusing on participatory governance, civic technology, and democratic innovation, this domain provides a clear pathway for leveraging decentralized systems to build resilient, transparent, and inclusive civic infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why Us?</strong> The OpenCivics Consortium is uniquely qualified to steward this domain. As an established, progressively decentralized organization, it offers the credible neutrality and expert domain knowledge required for domain stewardship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By funding this DDA, Gitcoin and the broader Ethereum community would visibly establish Ethereum as the indispensable infrastructure for democratic renewal, catalyze a new market for governance technology through public-protocol partnership, and demonstrate measurable civic impact at a global scale.</p>
<h1><a name="problem-impact-2" class="anchor" href="#problem-impact-2"></a>Problem &amp; Impact</h1>
<h2><a name="why-now-the-existential-imperative-for-democratic-renewal-3" class="anchor" href="#why-now-the-existential-imperative-for-democratic-renewal-3"></a>Why now?: The Existential Imperative for Democratic Renewal</h2>
<p>Contemporary civic systems face declining trust, polarization, inadequate representation, and the inability of traditional governance to meet complex global challenges. Institutions suffer from opaque decision-making, limited participation, and disconnection from community needs. Rising authoritarianism, civic disengagement, and failures on climate, inequality, and technology highlight the urgency of democratic renewal.</p>
<p>Traditional mechanisms ‚Äî elections, town halls, representative democracy ‚Äî were built for simpler times and now struggle with complexity and speed. This systemic ‚Äúdemocratic deficit‚Äù undermines legitimacy, weakens collective problem-solving, and fuels fragmentation.</p>
<p>For Ethereum, engaging these civic challenges is a strategic opportunity. The emerging ‚Äúcivic renaissance‚Äù could establish Ethereum as the substrate for citizen-driven governance, transparent resource allocation, and community-controlled infrastructure ‚Äî advancing human agency and collective intelligence. Civic innovation (DeCiv) represents Ethereum‚Äôs fourth wave, after programmable money, DeFi, and NFTs, grounding blockchain in civic purpose and unlocking vast new markets in governance, civic tech, and coordination.</p>
<h2><a name="sensemaking-analysis-4" class="anchor" href="#sensemaking-analysis-4"></a>Sensemaking Analysis</h2>
<p>The demand for a dedicated domain for open civic innovation is evidenced by a flourishing ecosystem of pioneer organizations and projects that are already building foundational tools and frameworks. Funding through this DDA would not be a start from scratch, but an acceleration of existing, vital efforts. The OpenCivics DDA is designed to provide a shared funding mechanism that strengthens and connects these disparate initiatives, creating a more robust and interoperable ‚Äúweb of impact.‚Äù The analysis in this report draws from the extensive database of OpenCivics member projects and related initiatives, mapping the participants in the domain to make visible the quality of contributors to the space and the demand for shared pools of public goods funding.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MetaGov:</strong> Functioning as a ‚Äúlaboratory for digital governance,‚Äù MetaGov‚Äôs mission is to ‚Äúcultivate tools, practices, and communities that enable self-governance in the digital age‚Äù. Its projects, such as DAOstar‚Äîa standards body for decentralized autonomous organizations‚Äîand Collective Voice‚Äîa tool for community-based financial approvals‚Äîare building the foundational governance layer for the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RadicalxChange:</strong> This organization focuses on strengthening civil society and rethinking public goods through projects on governance, property rights, and data rights. Their work on ‚ÄúData Dignity‚Äù highlights the need for democratic collective bargaining power over data, arguing that people should be able to exert collective control over their social data rather than having it exploited by large technology companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>g0v Taiwan:</strong> This civic hacker community is a global exemplar of the power of open civic innovation. They have successfully used technology to promote open government and public participation, with their projects leading to tangible governmental adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bloom Network:</strong> Bloom Network is an organization that mobilizes a global network of local chapters to build regenerative communities. These chapters, often called ‚ÄúBlooms,‚Äù are a decentralized system that works to connect, empower, and support individuals and groups in their efforts to create a more regenerative world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The OpenCivics DDA would provide a shared funding infrastructure that allows these disparate projects to be supported within a single, coherent domain. Funding a project like MetaGov‚Äôs DAO standards, for example, would not only benefit its own community but also provide foundational protocols for other civic innovators to build upon. This collective intelligence and cross-project coordination would amplify the overall impact of the domain, aligning with the OpenCivics Framework‚Äôs pluralistic and modular principles.</p>
<h2><a name="gitcoins-unique-role-fundraising-5" class="anchor" href="#gitcoins-unique-role-fundraising-5"></a>Gitcoin‚Äôs Unique Role &amp; Fundraising</h2>
<p>While the OpenCivics Consortium provides the deep domain expertise, community network, and framework for ‚ÄúOpen Civic Innovation,‚Äù Gitcoin offers the established infrastructure, broad reach, and a recognized public goods ethos that lends critical legitimacy. Our combined efforts create a powerful attractor for resources into a domain that would otherwise remain chronically unfunded and fragmented. This synergy allows us to surface vital civic projects that are currently overlooked by traditional funding mechanisms and even many web3 initiatives, effectively bridging the gap between innovative civic solutions and the capital required to scale them.</p>
<p>Through this collaborative model, Gitcoin and OpenCivics are not merely facilitating grants; they are co-creating a sustainable funding pipeline for the open civic renaissance. This partnership demonstrates how a leading public goods platform can work hand-in-hand with a specialized domain expert to identify, nurture, and scale crucial innovations that benefit society at large, ultimately positioning Ethereum as the indispensable infrastructure for the next generation of civic participation and collective problem-solving.</p>
<h3><a name="fundraising-reality-check-6" class="anchor" href="#fundraising-reality-check-6"></a>Fundraising Reality Check</h3>
<p>A $50K+ raise is feasible, building on our previous $30K track record for a round. Prospective sponsors include Octant v2, Celo Public Goods, Funding the Commons, Good Dollar, Omidyar Network, Sorensen and Rockefeller Foundations, and eventually public institutions.</p>
<p><em>Currently no committed sponsors; outreach is ongoing (<a href="mailto:team@opencivics.co">team@opencivics.co</a>).</em></p>
